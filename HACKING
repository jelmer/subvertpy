Backwards compatibility
=======================

subvertpy tries to stay compatible with older versions of the Subversion libraries.

The C API will generally add a new numbered function when new arguments are
added. In subvertpy, this would generally translate to a new optional argument
being added to the Python function. When that argument is absent, the old behaviour is
preserved and the old numbered function is called. When the argument is set,
the new numbered function is called - or if the new numbered function is not available,
NotImplementedError is raised.

This ensures that Python users of subvertpy can generally get by with not worrying
too much about newly introduced APIs unless they actually need the
functionality provided by them.

Coding Style
============

For Python code, please follow PEP8.

For C code, please use the Linux kernel coding style.

The source code is currently not very consistent and uses a mix of tabs and spaces.

Types

* UUIDs: str (on both Python 2 and Python 3)
